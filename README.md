Building Android (Lineage 17.1 or `/e/`) for LG G6 (h870)
========================================================

Building Android requires lots of RAM (at least 16GB) and a good CPU required.
Here are a set of helper scripts to build ROMs for the LG G6, leveraging the
OVH Public Cloud infrastructure.

Typical build time (from scratch) for a ROM is about 3 hours, which is about
1â‚¬ with the current hourly prices (2020).

## Details

This repository is made of three components:
* The main `build_android.sh` bash script which handles the actual build of
    the ROM (for the h870 device).
* A small Python module (`ovh_orchestrator`) responsible for spawning and
    purging instances in OVH Public Cloud.
* The main entrypoint `run.sh` which spawns an instance, runs the build on it
    copy back the built files and clean everything afterwards.

## Installation

```
cp ovh_orchestrator/config.example.py ovh_orchestrator/config.py
$EDITOR ovh_orchestrator/config.py  # Edit according to your own credentials / needs
```

## Usage

```
./run.sh
```

## Thanks

Many thanks to BernardoBas for his initial [unofficial
build](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-a10-h870-h870ds-h872-us997-lineageos-17-1-for-lg-g6-unofficial.4137809/)
and his help reproducing.
